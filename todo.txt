We have now to be able to launch training on two pcs in more production-ish evironement
Launch training on the same machine but 2 diffrent containes
Scale out and launch training on several machines

Low priority:
    We have to see how can we save the training results from our model.
    Kubernetes could be a good way of adding more abstraction.


We see that abstraction comes with the cost of documentation. I think that this tradeoff is worth it.
